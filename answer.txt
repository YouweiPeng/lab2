Q1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?

I can specify the TCP socket by using the socket library with s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) where AF_INET represents IPV4 and SOCK_STREAM represents TCP.

Q2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?

Client socket used to initiate a connection to a server sockets, send request whereas server socket is used to handle connections and give responses to requests.

Q3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?

We can use s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) , socket.SO_REUSEADDR allow us to reuse the same bind port.

Q4: What information do we get about incoming connections?

We can get the IP information and information in request of client socket.

Q5: What is returned by recv() from the server after the client is done sending the HTTP request?

We receive a empty byte string (b'')
