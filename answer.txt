Q1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?

I can specify the TCP socket by using the socket library with s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) where AF_INET represents IPV4 and SOCK_STREAM represents TCP.

Q2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?

Client socket used to initiate a connection to a server sockets, send request whereas server socket is used to handle connections and give responses to requests.

Q3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?

We can use s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) , socket.SO_REUSEADDR allow us to reuse the same bind port.

Q4: What information do we get about incoming connections?

We can get the IP information and information in request of client socket.

Q5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?

It prints out the request in client scripts because the server just send back what client send to it.  Or recv() receives data from the socket.
